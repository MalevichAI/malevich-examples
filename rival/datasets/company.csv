Rival,"Rival is a platform that allows AR/VR/Mixed reality content creators to post content they create. Think YouTube but for AR/VR/Mixed reality experiences. Instead of focusing on long experiences like games on Steam, Rival is planning to focus on shorter AR/VR/Mixed reality experiences and game trailers. Utilising its technology that allows cross-platform content viewing, Rival is planning to attract potential content creators to become users of their platform and post content there. Like this, when they launch, they will have content already that the general headset users will be able to watch."
